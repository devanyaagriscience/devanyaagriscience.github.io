Generate short 3d video about each product using Veo and show on product carousel when clicked. Also, use the 3d video to show the product in a 3d view.

Update actual information of each product in the product page. Do the same for the events, media and article.

Make 3D View color to green or yellow based on the theme but not blue.

Also the detailed product information is greyed out, please make sure the markdown is rendered properly for each product 

make sure the layout of the modal for products is similar to events, media and images ... where media is shown on top and infomation is below it (not side by side).
