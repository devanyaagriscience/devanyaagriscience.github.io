# Field Day: Hybrid Corn Showcase

## Seeing is Believing
In the fertile lands of Gorakhpur, we organized a **Field Day** to demonstrate the real-world performance of our latest Hybrid Corn varieties. Farmers were invited to inspect the standing crop and witness the harvest live.

## Observations
- **Uniform Cob Size**: The crop showed remarkable uniformity, a key trait for commercial value.
- **Grain Filling**: Cobs were filled to the tip, indicating excellent nutritional uptake and genetic potential.
- **Fodder Quality**: The green fodder quality remained high even at harvest, providing dual benefits.

## Farmer Feedback
"I have never seen such large cobs in this region. This variety is definitely going to change our profitability." - *Ram Kisan, Local Farmer*
