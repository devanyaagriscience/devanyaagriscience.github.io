# Paddy Kala Namak

## The Buddha Rice
**Kala Namak** is one of the finest aromatic rice varieties, often referred to as "Buddha Rice". It is renowned for its unique black husk and strong fragrance, which is said to be a gift from Lord Buddha to the people of Shravasti.

## Key Features
- **Exotic Aroma**: Strong, pleasant nutty aroma that is retained even after cooking.
- **Nutritional Powerhouse**: Rich in Iron and Zinc compared to common rice varieties.
- **Soft Texture**: Cooked rice is soft, fluffy, and highly palatable.

## Improved Research Variety
Our selection of Kala Namak maintains the traditional aroma and quality but improves upon the agronomic traits:

- **Higher Yield**: Significantly better yield than traditional landraces.
- **Better Grain Quality**: High milling recovery.

## Culinary Use
Perfect for making kheer, pulao, and as a table rice for special occasions. It pairs wonderfully with dal and mild curries.
